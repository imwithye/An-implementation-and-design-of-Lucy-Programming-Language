% the acknowledgments section

I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all those who provided me the possibility to complete this report. A special gratitude I give to my final year project supervisor, Dr. Huang Shell Ying, whose contribution in stimulating suggestions and encouragement, helped me to coordinate my project especially in writing this report. \\
Furthermore, I would also like to acknowledge with my friend, my roommate, Mr. Zhang Hanlin, who is the first person I discussed with about Lucy programming language. A special thanks go to my friend, my colleague, Mr. Zhou Xinzi, who proposed a lot of features and helped me to finalize the syntaxes of Lucy. \\
I would like to thank a girl, whom Lucy is named after. Also, I have to appreciate the Movie LUCY, which gave me a good excuse when I introduce Lucy to others. \\
Last but not least, I would like to thank all friends, developers that are interested in Lucy and their expectancy really encouraged me to finish Lucy programming language. \\
Without them, I would not able to complete the project.
