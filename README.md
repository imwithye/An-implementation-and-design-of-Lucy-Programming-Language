An implementation and design of Lucy programming language
===
This projects involves creating a new programming language named Lucy and its low level infrastructure. Lucy is a dynamic type language with static type checking. The goal of Lucy is to provide an elegant language syntax without losing those safe and powerful features. Lucy X and Lucy virtual machine is the low level infrastructure of Lucy which are designed to be as simple as possible. Lucy X and Lucy virtual machine aim to provide a mini compiler infrastructure for constructing a compiler for those who are interested in compiler techniques and designs. This report describes the syntaxes and features of Lucy and Lucy X as well as the implementation of Lucy compiler and Lucy virtual machine.
