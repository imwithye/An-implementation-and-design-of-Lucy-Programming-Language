\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this report introduce a new programming language named Lucy and a new low level language infrastructure. The Lucy language aims to be general purpose programming language which provides dynamic type and static type checking. Lucy's syntax is designed to be easy and elegant to improve the readability and prevent errors. The Lucy X and Lucy virtual machine tend to be simple and easy to understand. Beneficial from the small size of the instruction set, Lucy X and Lucy virtual machine is a good start point for those who are interested in compiler techniques and designs. In the future plan, Lucy will be rewritten by LLVM to achieve better performance and Lucy X and virtual machine will add an optimizing stage to make it become a full compiler infrastructure like LLVM. Lucy and Lucy X are not directly linked and they will be separated into two projects in the near future.
