\chapter{Linker Implementation}
The Lucy compiler aims to compile the Lucy code into Lucy X module with solving the local linkage. The \texttt{Import} keyword is reserved for global linkage. The global linkage is solved during linking time by the Lucy linker. This chapter first discusses how the routine and module are represented and how the global linking is solved for those global function calls. Then we discuss the detailed implementation of the Lucy linker.


\section{Subroutine Representation}
In Lucy X assembly language, functions are represented as subroutines. A subroutine provides scope isolation and stack memory for parameter passing and function execution. For each subroutine produced by the Lucy compiler, it will be prefixed with the module name to differentiate the subroutines.
\begin{lstlisting}
package "string"

func len(s: string) {}
\end{lstlisting}
will be translated to
\begin{lstlisting}[language=LucyX]
string:len {
  pop s
}
\end{lstlisting}
In this case, inside a package, even the two functions are in different files, they cannot be the same name. Otherwise when the global linker links all module files into one module, the naming will be duplicated and an \texttt{OverdefinedException} will be thrown. But if these two functions are in two different packages, it will be fine if they have the same name since they will be prefixed their package's name.

\section{Module Representation}
The linker will read in different module files and finally produce one final module. If the module files are some partial files of the package, the linker will merge them into one module and if the one of the module files is a main module, the linker will merge them and produce a new main module. Note that if the modules coming from different packages and there is no main module in those files, the linker will generate an exception, i.e. linker cannot link two modules from different packages except one of them is main module.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=LucyX]
; file 1
; module name: string
string:len{}

; file 2
; module name: string
string:charAt{}

; by default, it will be linked and merged into file string
string:len{}
string:charAt{}
\end{lstlisting}
The above example shows that to link a module, the linker simply merges all modules files into one. If the subroutine is already in the module, then an \texttt{OverdefinedException} will be thrown.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=LucyX]
; string
string:len{}
string:charAt{}

; array
array:len{}
array:remove{}

; main
main{}

; by default, it will merged into file main
string:len{}
string:charAt{}
array:len{}
array:remove{}
main{}
\end{lstlisting}
Linking an executable module is a little different with linking a pacakage. To link a package, the linker just merge all module files into one module and the module name will not be changed. In this case, the package name cannot be different in different module files. To link an executable module, the module files can come from different packakges and the linker will create a main module then all subroutines will be pushed into the main module.

\section{Global Semantic Analysis}
After linking separated modules files into one file, the global semantic analysis will be performed to check the correctness of the global linking. It checks the routine definition to ensure the all \texttt{call} instruction can be correctly executed. \\
The checking method simply collects all \texttt{call} instructions in the module and checks whether the target subroutine exists in the module. Moreover, the subroutine which is not called will be marked and removed in the optimization stage.
